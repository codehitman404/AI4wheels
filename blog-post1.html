        As electric vehicles become more common, the challenge isn't just building them—it's making them smart, efficient, and adaptive. That’s where AI steps in.
      </p>

      <p>
        From predictive maintenance to intelligent routing, AI is transforming how EV fleets operate in cities and logistics networks. Algorithms now anticipate battery degradation, suggest optimal charging windows, and even adapt routes in real time based on weather and traffic.

      <h3 class="mt-5">The Power of Data in Mobility</h3>
      <p>
        Every vehicle is a sensor. Telematics, onboard diagnostics, and real-time telemetry produce enormous amounts of data. AI turns that data into decisions—whether it's knowing when to service a vehicle or how to reduce downtime.

        "AI doesn’t just automate—it optimizes. It turns electric mobility into intelligent mobility."
      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="mt-5">What’s Next?</h3>
      <p>
        The future of EVs isn’t just electrified—it’s intelligent. As AI models improve and real-world data becomes more refined, the industry will shift from reactive to predictive, and from efficient to autonomous.
