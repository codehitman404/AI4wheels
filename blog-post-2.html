      <p class="lead">
        Our team at Georgetown set out to understand how organizations are navigating the journey of AI adoption. Through a blend of primary interviews and secondary research, we captured key lessons, challenges, and success strategies that are shaping the future of intelligent enterprise.
      </p>

      <h3>🎯 The Objective</h3>
      <p>
        We interviewed over 20 professionals from across industries—automotive, healthcare, finance, and technology. These individuals represented functions ranging from software engineering and customer service to senior management. Our goal: identify what works, what doesn’t, and what’s next for AI at work.
      </p>

      <h3>📊 Key Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Productivity Gains:</strong> AI is improving coding efficiency by up to 40% in software roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Organic Adoption:</strong> Employees often start using AI tools independently before formal rollout.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Metrics:</strong> Each function needs its own way to measure AI’s success.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Privacy Concerns:</strong> 63% of leaders cite data governance as a key barrier.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🧠 The Power of Personas</h3>
      <p>
        We categorized users into four types: Worker-User, Worker-Non-User, Management-User, and Management-Non-User. Each group had different motivations and resistance points—allowing us to build more tailored strategies.

      </blockquote>

      <h3>🔧 Strategy Implications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short Term:</strong> Tailored AI training, AI peer groups, and executive workshops.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Term:</strong> Internal AI taskforces, performance-linked adoption rewards, and ethical oversight boards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📈 Use Cases Worth Watching</h3>
      <p>
        From AI-powered reconciliation in finance, to automated customer support in airlines, real-world applications show measurable impact. Microsoft Copilot and SkodaGPT are being used to streamline operations, summarize financial data, and automate routine reporting.
      </p>

      <h3>🚧 Challenges Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        Resistance isn't just about fear of job loss—it’s about trust. Output inaccuracy, unclear benefits, and data concerns remain the biggest obstacles.
